# first_person_prototype
My bachelor project. 

For my bachelor thesis I created a prototype within 6 weeks, with a programmer to help me out. Excluding the palm trees, rocks and bushes, I did all the environment assets and characters. 
To create the scene, I used the unity terrain tool. I also did the particles. 
My thesis was about the entertaining factors of three-dimensional open-world games in relation to gameplay elemants, story and environment. That means that I organised some people to playtest the prototype and answer some questions about their feelings of joy during the game.
